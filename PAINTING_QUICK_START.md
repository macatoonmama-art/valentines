# 🎨 New Feature: My Painting - Quick Start

## What's New ✨
A brand new **"My Painting"** folder has been added to your Love System desktop! This feature displays a portrait using an innovative CSS text-background-image technique.

## Desktop Icon

## How to Use

### 1. Add Your Portrait Image

### 2. Open the Folder
